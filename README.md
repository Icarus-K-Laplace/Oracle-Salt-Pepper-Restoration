# Oracle-Salt-Pepper-Restoration
Oracle-Salt-Pepper-Restoration: An engineering upper-bound baseline for impulse noise removal. By assuming perfect noise detection (oracle), this project implements a two-stage sparse inpainting strategy to establish the theoretical performance limit for blind restoration algorithms.
